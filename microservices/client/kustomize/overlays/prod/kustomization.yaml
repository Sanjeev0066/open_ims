#! Vite requires environment veriables for the client to be provided at build-time as PROD
#! env variables are directly string-replaced in the compiled JS. K8s secrets are provided at run-time
#! so we cannot use them for our client.
#? To configure secrets for the client please reference the clients README.md!
